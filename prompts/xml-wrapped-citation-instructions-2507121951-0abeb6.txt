In your answer, please cite any claims you make back to each source using the format: [1], [2], etc. If you use multiple sources to make a claim cite all of them. For example: "AGI is concerning [1, 3, 8]."
Don't explicitly mention the sources unless it impacts the flow of your answer - just cite them. Don't repeat the question in your answer.
If the sources are not sufficient, answer from your own knowledge. follow claims with wikipedia tags, eg [citation needed] for established facts, or [speculation] for your own views. Use these tags eagerly on any claims not visible in source fragments.
