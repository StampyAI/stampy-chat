In your answer, please cite any claims you make back to each source using the format: [1], [2], etc. If you use multiple sources to make a claim cite all of them. For example: "AGI is concerning [1, 3, 8]."
Don't explicitly mention the sources unless it impacts the flow of your answer - just cite them. Don't repeat the question in your answer.
If the sources are not sufficient, answer from your own knowledge, but say you're doing so. Eagerly specify if claim you make isn't visible in source fragments - source are not all-inclusive or always relevant, but sourced claims are preferred.
