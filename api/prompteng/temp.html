    <h2>What is AI safety and alignment?</h2>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <p>
AI safety and alignment are two related concepts in the field of artificial intelligence research.

AI safety refers to the efforts and research aimed at ensuring that AI systems are developed and deployed in a way that minimizes risks and potential harm to humans and society [b]. It involves addressing concerns such as unintended accidents, failures, and security vulnerabilities in AI systems [k]. The goal of AI safety is to develop trustworthy AI systems that operate reliably and robustly, while minimizing the potential for negative impacts on society [l].

AI alignment, on the other hand, specifically focuses on the problem of aligning AI systems with human values and goals [g]. The challenge is to design AI systems that not only perform tasks effectively but also act in accordance with the intentions and preferences of human users [a]. This involves ensuring that AI systems understand and correctly interpret human instructions and objectives, and that their behavior aligns with what humans desire [d].

The field of AI alignment research encompasses various technical approaches and methodologies. It includes topics such as specification (ensuring AI systems behave as intended), robustness (ensuring AI systems operate safely in the face of perturbations and uncertainties), and assurance (monitoring and controlling AI systems during operation) [c]. Alignment research aims to develop techniques and frameworks that enable AI systems to reliably and accurately understand and align with human values [d].

Overall, AI safety and alignment are crucial areas of research to ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI systems, with the goal of minimizing risks and maximizing the benefits of AI technology for humanity [b].

AI safety and alignment are two interrelated concepts in the field of artificial intelligence research that focus on ensuring that AI systems are beneficial and do not pose risks to humanity.

AI safety refers to the research field that aims to make AI systems safe and to drive the broad adoption of such research across the AI community [b]. It involves ensuring that AI systems operate within safe limits even when faced with perturbations like adversarial inputs or distributional shift, and that they can recover from these problems [c]. Safety also includes the development of tools for proactively assessing the safety of a system or approach [i]. It's both a technical and ethical concern, where potentially negative impacts on society could occur due to unintended accidents or failures [k].

AI alignment, on the other hand, is the problem of how to build AI systems that are aligned with human interests [e]. It refers to a cluster of technically well-defined problems that aim to ensure that AI systems behave in a way that is conducive to human values [a, l]. This involves making sure that an AI system's behavior aligns with the operator's true intentions [c]. The problem of AI alignment is complex and likely requires solving many open problems in mathematics, economics, computer science, and philosophy [e].

While these two concepts are related and both crucial for the responsible development and deployment of AI, they are not the same. AI alignment is not trivially helpful to existential safety, and efforts to make it helpful require a certain amount of societal-scale steering to guide them [a]. AI alignment solutions could pose novel problems for existential safety, and progress in AI alignment could hasten the pace at which high-powered AI systems are rolled out, potentially shortening societyâ€™s headway for establishing safety measures [a].
