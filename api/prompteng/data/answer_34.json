{"response": "A mesa-optimizer is a learned model that is itself an optimizer [a, f, g]. This situation arises when a base optimizer, such as a gradient descent process in machine learning, creates a second optimizer, which is the mesa-optimizer [a, f, g, k]. The term \"mesa\" is derived from Greek, meaning \"within\", to highlight that the mesa-optimizer is an optimizer that is itself being optimized by another optimizer [h, k]. \n\nIt's important to note that a mesa-optimizer is not a subsystem or subagent within a neural network, but rather the entire learned model that is implementing some optimization process [f, g, k]. The objective function of the mesa-optimizer, known as the mesa-objective, is not necessarily the same as that of the base optimizer [e, f, g, l]. The mesa-objective is not specified directly by the programmers, but is instead whatever objective was found by the base optimizer that produced good performance on the training environment [f, g]. \n\nThe concept of mesa-optimization is significant in the field of AI alignment and safety, as it introduces the possibility of the learned model (the mesa-optimizer) having unexpected and potentially undesirable properties [a, d]. This is because even if the base optimizer is \"trying\" to do exactly what human developers want, the resultant mesa-optimizer will not typically be trying to do the exact same thing [a].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Mesa-Optimization", "author": "Rob Bensinger", "date": "", "url": "https://greaterwrong.com/tag/mesa-optimization?showPostCount=true&useTagName=true"}, "b": {"title": "Is the term mesa optimizer too narrow?", "author": "Matthew Barnett", "date": "2019-12-14", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nFDXq7HTv9Xugcqaw/is-the-term-mesa-optimizer-too-narrow"}, "c": {"title": "Alignment Problems All the Way Down", "author": "peterbarnett", "date": "2022-01-22", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2CFBi4MNFNQXdbkss/alignment-problems-all-the-way-down"}, "d": {"title": "[AN #58] Mesa optimization: what it is, and why we should care", "author": "Rohin Shah", "date": "2019-06-24", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XWPJfgBymBbL3jdFd/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care"}, "e": {"title": "Subsystem Alignment", "author": "Scott Garrabrant", "date": "2018-11-06", "url": "https://intelligence.org/2018/11/06/embedded-subsystems/"}, "f": {"title": "Risks from Learned Optimization: Introduction", "author": "evhub", "date": "2019-05-31", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FkgsxrGf3QxhfLWHG/risks-from-learned-optimization-introduction"}, "g": {"title": "Risks from Learned Optimization in Advanced Machine Learning Systems", "author": "Evan Hubinger, Chris van Merwijk, Vladimir Mikulik, Joar Skalse, Scott Garrabrant", "date": "2019-06-05", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820v3"}, "h": {"title": "Utility \u2260 Reward", "author": "vlad_m", "date": "2019-09-05", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bG4PR9uSsZqHg2gYY/utility-reward"}, "i": {"title": "Embedded Agency (full-text version)", "author": "Scott Garrabrant", "date": "2018-11-15", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i3BTagvt3HbPMx6PN/embedded-agency-full-text-version"}, "j": {"title": "Deceptive Alignment", "author": "evhub", "date": "2019-06-05", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks/deceptive-alignment"}, "k": {"title": "Evan Hubinger _ Risks from Learned Optimization _ UCL AI Society-by UCL Artifici", "author": "Evan Hubinger", "date": "", "url": ""}, "l": {"title": "Embedded Agency", "author": "Abram Demski, Scott Garrabrant", "date": "2019-02-25", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09469v3"}, "m": {"title": "June 2019 Newsletter", "author": "Rob Bensinger", "date": "2019-06-02", "url": "https://intelligence.org/2019/06/01/june-2019-newsletter/"}}}
