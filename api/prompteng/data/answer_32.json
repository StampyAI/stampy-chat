{"response": "Paul Christiano holds several beliefs related to AI alignment and safety. \n\n1. He is relatively optimistic about the alignment problem: Christiano believes that many theoretical or algorithmic problems are either solvable within a reasonable timeframe or provably impossible. He also thinks that the fact that many AI safety problems haven't been solved yet doesn't necessarily provide strong evidence about their difficulty [f].\n\n2. He has a narrower conception of the alignment problem: Christiano's criterion for alignment success isn't ensuring that all future intelligences are aligned. Instead, it's about leaving the next generation of intelligences in at least as good a place as humans were when building them [f].\n\n3. He believes in the possibility of a significant failure: Christiano thinks that one should be open to the possibility of a massive failure on an issue that many people are aware of, due to a variety of factors such as institutional issues, politicization, and the difficulty of doing new things [h].\n\n4. He is open to disagreement and uncertainty: Christiano acknowledges that his views aren't entirely internally coherent and that he doesn't fully understand others' views. He also recognizes that there's a lot of disagreement about the difficulty of the alignment problem [a].\n\n5. He believes in the value of evidence and learning: Christiano thinks that evidence will roll in once we have more powerful AI systems, and that we can learn a lot about relevant institutions and the views of people [c].\n\n6. He is willing to bet against superforecasters: In a conversation with Cotra and Yudkowsky, Christiano expressed that he would bet against superforecasters, indicating a belief in his own predictive abilities or views [b].\n\n7. He believes in the importance of handling AI risks better than past crises: Christiano has expressed the view that handling the alignment problem may be harder than completely eradicating COVID-19, and that it's important to handle this potential scenario better than we handled the pandemic [h].\n\nThese beliefs are based on his work in AI alignment at OpenAI and his interactions with other researchers in the field [f, a, b, c, h].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Conversation with Paul Christiano", "author": "abergal", "date": "2019-09-11", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qnYZmtpNPZyqHpot9/conversation-with-paul-christiano"}, "b": {"title": "Christiano, Cotra, and Yudkowsky on AI progress", "author": "Rob Bensinger", "date": "2021-11-25", "url": "https://intelligence.org/2021/11/25/christiano-cotra-and-yudkowsky-on-ai-progress/"}, "c": {"title": "Conversation with Paul Christiano", "author": "Asya Bergal", "date": "2019-09-11", "url": "https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-paul-christiano/"}, "d": {"title": "More Christiano, Cotra, and Yudkowsky on AI progress", "author": "Eliezer Yudkowsky", "date": "2021-12-06", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fS7Zdj2e2xMqE6qja/more-christiano-cotra-and-yudkowsky-on-ai-progress"}, "e": {"title": "More Christiano, Cotra, and Yudkowsky on AI progress", "author": "Rob Bensinger", "date": "2021-12-07", "url": "https://intelligence.org/2021/12/06/more-christiano-cotra-and-yudkowsky-on-ai-progress/"}, "f": {"title": "Paul Christiano on the safety of future AI systems", "author": "Asya Bergal", "date": "2019-09-11", "url": "https://aiimpacts.org/paul-christiano-on/"}, "g": {"title": "Current thoughts on Paul Christano\u2019s research agenda", "author": "jessicata", "date": "2017-07-16", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037545b/current-thoughts-on-paul-christano-s-research-agenda"}, "h": {"title": "AXRP Episode 12 - AI Existential Risk with Paul Christiano", "author": "DanielFilan", "date": "2021-12-02", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/krsjmpDB4kgDq6pdu/axrp-episode-12-ai-existential-risk-with-paul-christiano"}, "i": {"title": "Christiano, Cotra, and Yudkowsky on AI progress", "author": "Eliezer Yudkowsky", "date": "2021-11-25", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7MCqRnZzvszsxgtJi/christiano-cotra-and-yudkowsky-on-ai-progress"}}}
