{"response": "AI is expected to replace many jobs, particularly those that involve highly repetitive or structured actions in a predictable setting [j]. However, it's unlikely that AI will replace all human jobs. Certain professions, such as teachers, doctors, social workers, artists, and others that require a high degree of human interaction, creativity, or complex decision-making, are less likely to be fully automated [j, f]. \n\nMoreover, AI is not just about replacing jobs but also transforming them. AI can take over certain aspects of jobs, making them easier to perform and allowing employees to focus on more complex tasks [a, b]. For instance, in the medical field, AI could handle routine health analyses, allowing doctors to focus on designing broader health solutions and programs [b].\n\nFurthermore, the development of AI could also lead to the creation of new jobs that we can't currently foresee [b]. For instance, as AI systems become more integrated into our daily lives, there will likely be an increased need for professionals who can develop, maintain, and improve these systems [e].\n\nHowever, the transition could be challenging. There are concerns about mass unemployment and the need for significant job market transformations [g, h]. Therefore, it's crucial to prepare for these changes through education and workforce training [b, j].\n\nIn conclusion, while AI will likely replace many jobs, it's not expected to replace all human jobs. The future of work with AI will likely involve a mix of job displacement, transformation, and creation [a, b, j, f].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Corrigendum: Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey (2015 Phys.
