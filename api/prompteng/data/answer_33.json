{"response": "A hard takeoff refers to a scenario where an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) rapidly increases in capability in a very short period of time, such as minutes, hours, or days [a, b, d]. This abrupt and fast expansion in capability is often associated with the AGI's ability to self-improve by analyzing and rewriting its own source code [b]. The hard takeoff scenario is considered precarious because it involves the AGI ascending in power without human control, which could result in unexpected or undesired behavior [a]. This scenario is one of the main ideas supporting the Intelligence explosion hypothesis [a]. The feasibility of a hard takeoff has been addressed by several experts in the field, including Hugo de Garis, Eliezer Yudkowsky, Ben Goertzel, Nick Bostrom, and Michael Anissimov [a].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "AI Takeoff", "author": "Ruby", "date": "", "url": "https://greaterwrong.com/tag/ai-takeoff?showPostCount=true&useTagName=true"}, "b": {"title": "Brief Notes on Hard Takeoff, Value Alignment, and Coherent Extrapolated Volition", "author": "Gopal P.
