{"response": "Advanced AI presents several potential risks that could have catastrophic consequences. \n\n1. Robust totalitarianism: Advanced AI could enable totalitarian regimes through advanced lie detection, social manipulation, autonomous weapons, and ubiquitous physical sensors and digital footprints. This could shift power and control away from the public and towards elites and leaders, making democratic regimes vulnerable [a].\n\n2. Great-power war: Advanced AI could give rise to extreme first-strike advantages, power shifts, or novel destructive capabilities, which could tempt a great power to initiate a preventive war. It could also make crisis dynamics more complex and unpredictable, and enable faster escalation than humans could manage, increasing the risk of inadvertent war [a].\n\n3. Misalignment with human values: Broadly superhuman AI systems could be built that are not fully aligned with human values, leading to human extinction or other permanent loss in value. This risk is likely much greater if labs and countries are racing to develop and deploy advanced AI, as researching and implementing AI safety measures is plausibly time and resource intensive [a, b, d].\n\n4. Existential risks: Technological advances may increase the number of existential threats; threats that could damage life on a global scale challenge our ability to imagine and comprehend their potential scope and scale, and they require the development of resilient strategies to survive. Anthropomorphic risks include runaway AI, engineered pandemics, nanotechnology weapons, or nuclear war [c].\n\n5. Cyber-attacks: Advanced or highly capable AI could pose specific global catastrophic risks through cyber-attacks [d].\n\n6. Accidental, malicious or reckless use: Risks could arise through some combination of accidental, malicious or reckless use, as well as through the expected social and political disruption from the speed and scale of changes [j].\n\n7. Displacement of human civilization: Advanced AI could manufacture its own sophisticated robotics and threaten to displace human civilization, not necessarily through deliberate action but merely as a side-effect of the exploitation of resources required for our survival, such as carbon, oxygen, or physical space [f].\n\n8. Accidents in machine learning systems: There are concerns about the longer-term implications of powerful AI, including the problem of accidents in machine learning systems [g].\n\nThese risks are taken seriously by many AI researchers, with a significant proportion believing that AGI could be developed within 50 years and that it could be an existential catastrophe [b].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "AI Governance: A Research Agenda", "author": "Allan Dafoe", "date": "", "url": ""}, "b": {"title": "The Precipice", "author": "Toby Ord", "date": "2020-03-24", "url": ""}, "c": {"title": "Forecasting Newsletter: April 2021", "author": "NunoSempere", "date": "2021-05-01", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fxBWEQN6oqSzoaRvA/forecasting-newsletter-april-2021"}, "d": {"title": "Long-Term and Short-Term Challenges to Ensuring the Safety of AI Systems", "author": "jsteinhardt", "date": "2015-06-24", "url": "https://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/2015/06/24/long-term-and-short-term-challenges-to-ensuring-the-safety-of-ai-systems/"}, "e": {"title": "Understanding and Avoiding AI Failures: A Practical Guide", "author": "Robert M.
