{"response": "There are several ways you can contribute to AI safety and alignment:\n\n1. **Research**: AI alignment is a complex problem that requires solving many open problems in mathematics, economics, computer science, and philosophy [b]. You can contribute by conducting research in these areas. This could involve working on technical questions about AI safety, such as identifying alignment strategies that are scalable, safe, and competitive [g]. \n\n2. **Education**: Learning about AI safety and alignment is a crucial first step. This could involve taking courses in machine learning and AI safety [g]. Reading widely on the topic, such as through the AI alignment newsletter, can also help you understand the context for new research [g].\n\n3. **Advocacy**: Raising awareness about the importance of AI safety and alignment can help ensure that these issues receive the attention they deserve. This could involve advocating for more research in this area, or promoting the importance of AI safety and alignment in policy discussions [l].\n\n4. **Career**: If you have a background in STEM, you could consider a career in AI safety research. This could involve working at organizations focused on AI alignment, such as MIRI, UC Berkeley, the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford, and other institutions [l].\n\n5. **Donation**: If you're not in a position to contribute directly through research or advocacy, you can still help by donating to organizations that are working on AI safety and alignment [l].\n\nRemember, the goal is to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and interests, and that their safety research will be used to build their successors [j]. This is a complex and challenging problem, but every contribution helps [b, g, l].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Some AI research areas and their relevance to existential safety", "author": "Andrew_Critch", "date": "2020-11-19", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hvGoYXi2kgnS3vxqb/some-ai-research-areas-and-their-relevance-to-existential-1"}, "b": {"title": "Robustness to fundamental uncertainty in AGI alignment", "author": "G Gordon Worley III", "date": "2018-07-25", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09836v2"}, "c": {"title": "Evolutionary Computation and AI Safety: Research Problems Impeding Routine and Safe Real-world Appli", "author": "Joel Lehman", "date": "2019-06-24", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10189v2"}, "d": {"title": "Friday Seminar Series- Gillian Hadfield - AI Alignment and Human Normativity-by ", "author": "Gillian Hadfield", "date": "", "url": ""}, "e": {"title": "Towards an Axiological Approach to AI Alignment", "author": "G Gordon Worley III", "date": "2017-11-15", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NwxjvegAbLaBJ3TvC/towards-an-axiological-approach-to-ai-alignment-1"}, "f": {"title": "AGI Safety From First Principles", "author": "Richard Ngo", "date": "", "url": ""}, "g": {"title": "How I think students should orient to AI safety _ Buck Shlegeris _ EA Student Su", "author": "Buck Shlegeris, Sofia Davis Vogel", "date": "", "url": ""}, "h": {"title": "Formally Stating the AI Alignment Problem", "author": "G Gordon Worley III", "date": "2018-02-19", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7dvDgqvqqziSKweRs/formally-stating-the-ai-alignment-problem-1"}, "i": {"title": "Andy Jones - AI Safety and the Scaling Hypothesis-by Towards Data Science-video_", "author": "Andy Jones, Jeremie Harris", "date": "", "url": ""}, "j": {"title": "AGI safety from first principles: Control", "author": "Richard_Ngo", "date": "2020-10-02", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eGihD5jnD6LFzgDZA/agi-safety-from-first-principles-control"}, "k": {"title": "Safety engineering, target selection, and alignment theory", "author": "So8res", "date": "2015-12-31", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uP87YbXrCDCw78rJF/safety-engineering-target-selection-and-alignment-theory"}, "l": {"title": "Safety engineering, target selection, and alignment theory", "author": "Nate Soares", "date": "2015-12-31", "url": "https://intelligence.org/2015/12/31/safety-engineering-target-selection-and-alignment-theory/"}, "m": {"title": "AI Development for the Public Interest: From Abstraction Traps to Sociotechnical Risks", "author": "McKane Andrus, Sarah Dean, Thomas Krendl Gilbert, Nathan Lambert, Tom Zick", "date": "2021-02-04", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04255v1"}, "n": {"title": "A General Language Assistant as a Laboratory for Alignment", "author": "Amanda Askell, Yuntao Bai, Anna Chen, Dawn Drain, Deep Ganguli, Tom Henighan, Andy Jones, Nicholas J", "date": "2021-12-01", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00861v3"}, "o": {"title": "Alignment Newsletter #27", "author": "Rohin Shah", "date": "2018-10-09", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g7yj6afwKf5GurCyZ/alignment-newsletter-27"}}}
