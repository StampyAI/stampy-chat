{"response": "Programming AI to behave ethically is a complex challenge that researchers are actively exploring. The difficulty lies in the fact that ethical behavior is not easily defined or quantified, and what is considered ethical can vary greatly among different cultures, societies, and individuals [c, f, m]. \n\nOne approach to this problem is to provide AI with examples of human behavior that is considered ethical, from which the AI could formulate a general theory of ethics [k]. However, this approach assumes that there is a consistent and universally accepted definition of ethical behavior, which is not the case. \n\nAnother approach is to build AI systems that can make appropriate moral choices, a field known as 'machine ethics' [j]. This involves creating AI systems that are designed to make decisions that align with human values and moral principles. However, this is a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of human values [f, j].\n\nMoreover, the ethical behavior of AI systems is not just about the decisions they make, but also about how they interact with humans and the environment. For instance, AI systems should be designed to respect human autonomy and not to exploit human vulnerabilities [i, h].\n\nIn addition, the ethical behavior of AI systems should be adaptable to changing circumstances and societal norms. This is known as the 'value alignment problem', which refers to the challenge of ensuring that AI systems continue to act in ways that align with human values as those values evolve over time [e, n].\n\nIn conclusion, while it is theoretically possible to program AI to behave ethically, doing so in practice is a complex and ongoing challenge that requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving not only computer scientists and AI researchers, but also ethicists, sociologists, and other stakeholders [a, g].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "A survey of research questions for robust and beneficial AI", "author": "Steve Babcock, J\u00e1nos Greidinger, Richard Kram\u00e1r, Max Mallah,  Tegmark, Anthony Aguirre, Erik Brynjol", "date": "", "url": ""}, "b": {"title": "So You Want to Save the World", "author": "lukeprog", "date": "2012-01-01", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5BJvusxdwNXYQ4L9L/so-you-want-to-save-the-world"}, "c": {"title": "Learning from Learning Machines: Optimisation, Rules, and Social Norms", "author": "Travis LaCroix, Yoshua Bengio", "date": "2019-12-29", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00006v1"}, "d": {"title": "Social choice ethics in artificial intelligence", "author": "Seth Baum, Springer-Verlag London", "date": "", "url": "10.1007/s00146-017-0760-1"}, "e": {"title": "Ethical Reflections on Artificial Intelligence *", "author": "Brian Green", "date": "", "url": "10.12775/SetF.2018.015"}, "f": {"title": "Challenges of Aligning Artificial Intelligence with Human Values", "author": "Margit Sutrop", "date": "", "url": "10.11590/abhps.2020.2.04"}, "g": {"title": "Building Ethics into Artificial Intelligence", "author": "Han Yu, Zhiqi Shen, Chunyan Miao, Cyril Leung, Victor R.
