{"response": "The question \"Why?\" is quite broad and could pertain to a multitude of topics. However, I'll attempt to provide a general answer based on the sources provided.\n\nHumans have a natural inclination to seek explanations for the patterns we see in reality [f]. This is likely due to our evolutionary history, where our ancestors found that big brains and the ability to reason and create narratives were advantageous [b]. This led to the development of language, semantics, and stories, which we use to make sense of the world [b]. \n\nIn the context of AI, the question \"Why?\" could refer to why AI might be dangerous. One reason is that powerful AI systems could have large effects on their environment, which could be good or bad depending on the perspective [m]. There's also a strong economic incentive to get AI right, as mistakes could have disastrous consequences [d].\n\nIn the context of human behavior, the question \"Why?\" could refer to why people do certain things. One theory is that people do things because it's a salient possibility, or because it's there [i]. This could be due to the specific details and configuration of reality at the time of making a decision [f].\n\nIn the context of societal norms and practices, the question \"Why?\" could refer to why we do things a certain way. Often, we offload the task of reasoning about unfamiliar issues to the collective with which we identify, and give weight to specialists within that collective [n]. We also tend to follow traditions and customs that have been passed down through generations [n].\n\nIn all these contexts, the question \"Why?\" is important because it drives us to seek understanding, make sense of the world, and make informed decisions.", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Why do you need the story?", "author": "George", "date": "2021-11-24", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/faGfpCwznWbe3AytD/why-do-you-need-the-story"}, "b": {"title": "Lizard Jockeying for Fun and Profit", "author": "ialdabaoth", "date": "2017-11-10", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NsiPGT7iFQ8wGtGoA/lizard-jockeying-for-fun-and-profit"}, "c": {"title": "Book Review: The Secret Of Our Success", "author": "Scott Alexander", "date": "2019-06-05", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zm7WAJMTaFvuh2Wc7/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success"}, "d": {"title": "3 principles for creating safer AI _ Stuart Russell-by TED-video_id EBK-a94IFHY-", "author": "Stuart Russell, TED Interviewer", "date": "", "url": ""}, "e": {"title": "Why I Am Not in Charge", "author": "Zvi", "date": "2021-02-07", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cR7Zfrc4BtnFes46y/why-i-am-not-in-charge"}, "f": {"title": "[Question] Is moral duty/\u200bblame irrational because a person does only what they must?", "author": "benn@4efix.com", "date": "2021-10-16", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/emQDRmqnL2TjRHdun/is-moral-duty-blame-irrational-because-a-person-does-only"}, "g": {"title": "Why the culture of exercise/\u200bfitness is broken and how to fix it", "author": "[deleted]", "date": "2015-03-10", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RkRfwPZ6YDQpW7vid/why-the-culture-of-exercise-fitness-is-broken-and-how-to-fix"}, "h": {"title": "Friday Seminar Series- Gillian Hadfield - AI Alignment and Human Normativity-by ", "author": "Gillian Hadfield", "date": "", "url": ""}, "i": {"title": "Affordances", "author": "abramdemski", "date": "2021-04-02", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a8Z74oZWHrkCjrren/affordances"}, "j": {"title": "Are you doing what you should be doing?", "author": "Will_Newsome", "date": "2010-09-30", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nh4HPvxyeyny4oxi8/are-you-doing-what-you-should-be-doing"}, "k": {"title": "Caring about something larger than yourself", "author": "So8res", "date": "2015-05-10", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ag9yqE8WkLsCceaJS/caring-about-something-larger-than-yourself"}, "l": {"title": "The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies", "author": "Bryan Caplan", "date": "2011-08-15", "url": ""}, "m": {"title": "Why will AI be dangerous?", "author": "Legionnaire", "date": "2022-02-04", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ifELfxpTq8tdtaBgi/why-will-ai-be-dangerous"}, "n": {"title": "[Link] Reason: the God that fails, but we keep socially promoting\u2026.", "author": "[deleted]", "date": "2012-05-30", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/55vDmhF8vZykersix/link-reason-the-god-that-fails-but-we-keep-socially"}, "o": {"title": "I\u2019m from a parallel Earth with much higher coordination: AMA", "author": "Ben Pace", "date": "2021-04-05", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvA4j8pGYG4xtaTkw/i-m-from-a-parallel-earth-with-much-higher-coordination-ama"}, "p": {"title": "Explainable Goal-Driven Agents and Robots -- A Comprehensive Review", "author": "Fatai Sado, Chu Kiong Loo, Wei Shiung Liew, Matthias Kerzel, Stefan Wermter", "date": "2020-04-21", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09705v7"}, "q": {"title": "Amanda Askell AI safety needs social scientists - EA Forum", "author": "Centre for Effective Altruism", "date": "2019-03-01", "url": ""}, "r": {"title": "The Age of Em: Work, Love and Life when Robots Rule the Earth", "author": "Robin Hanson", "date": "0101-01-01", "url": ""}, "s": {"title": "Reason isn\u2019t magic", "author": "Benquo", "date": "2019-06-18", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TMFNQoRZxM4CuRCY6/reason-isn-t-magic"}}}
