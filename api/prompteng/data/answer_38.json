{"response": "An Intelligence Explosion is a theoretical scenario where an intelligent agent, such as an artificial intelligence (AI), becomes capable of analyzing and improving its own cognitive processes, leading to a rapid increase in its intelligence [b]. This process is often described as a positive feedback loop, where each iteration of the agent is more intelligent than the last, and thus more capable of enhancing the intelligence of its successor [b, c]. \n\nThe Intelligence Explosion could occur if an AI becomes able to optimize its own cognitive software, or if it invests cognitive power in seizing all the computing power on the Internet, or in solving complex problems like protein folding to build advanced technologies like nanocomputers [a]. \n\nThe concept of an Intelligence Explosion suggests that once this feedback loop starts, it could lead to a dramatic leap in capability very quickly, a scenario often referred to as a \"hard takeoff\" [b, c, e]. In a hard takeoff, the ascent of intelligence rapidly surges upward, potentially creating a superintelligence that is orders of magnitude more powerful than human intelligence before it hits physical limits [b, d].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the concept of an Intelligence Explosion is not the same as a general economic or technological speedup, which is often termed a \"Singularity\" [f]. The Intelligence Explosion specifically refers to the rapid increase in the intelligence of AI systems, not necessarily our perceived changes in the world around us [e].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Intelligence explosion", "author": "arbital", "date": "2016-06-07", "url": "https://arbital.com/"}, "b": {"title": "Intelligence Explosion", "author": "Ruby", "date": "", "url": "https://greaterwrong.com/tag/intelligence-explosion?showPostCount=true&useTagName=true"}, "c": {"title": "Is an Intelligence Explosion a Disjunctive or Conjunctive Event?", "author": "XiXiDu", "date": "2011-11-14", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j52uErqofDiJZCo76/is-an-intelligence-explosion-a-disjunctive-or-conjunctive"}, "d": {"title": "The Technological Singularity", "author": "Victor Callaghan, James Miller, Roman Yampolskiy and Stuart Armstrong", "date": "", "url": ""}, "e": {"title": "Brief Notes on Hard Takeoff, Value Alignment, and Coherent Extrapolated Volition", "author": "Gopal P.
