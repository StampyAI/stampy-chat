{"response": "Policymakers and regulators play a crucial role in ensuring AI safety and alignment. They are responsible for creating policy and ethical recommendations for AI governance, which can help address public concerns about the social impacts of AI [a]. However, their understanding of AI may differ from those of AI researchers, which can lead to challenges in defining AI for regulatory purposes [a]. \n\nRegulators can also create a market for regulation, where private sector organizations compete to achieve regulatory outcomes set by a government regulator. This approach can help adapt regulatory systems to the pace, complexity, and global reach of AI [b]. However, the implementation of these regulations is often dependent on the voluntary or self-regulatory efforts of the companies deploying AI, which can lead to conflicts of interest [b].\n\nPolicymakers should consider guidelines for AI as a legislative checklist, and consider whether to subject AI research and development to review. They should also consider applying a burden of proof or a precautionary principle to high-risk AI activities [c]. Policymakers, lawyers, and corporate leaders should communicate regularly about issues that may define the tone, tenor, and content of government-industry relations [c].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that pushing directly for policy can hinder expert consensus and risk being pattern-matched to ignorant opposition to technological progress. AI researchers who are dismissive of safety law may be harder to convince of the need to voluntarily be extra-safe [e, f, j].\n\nRegulation of AI is particularly tricky to get right, as it requires a detailed understanding of the technology on the part of regulators. Poorly-designed regulation can discourage innovation and even increase risks to the public [g]. Therefore, it's crucial to craft AI policies in alignment with systematic assessments of how, when, and why AI applications enable broader forms of sociotechnical change [i].\n\nIn conclusion, policymakers and regulators play a vital role in ensuring AI safety and alignment, but they must navigate a complex landscape that requires a deep understanding of AI, careful crafting of regulations, and ongoing communication with AI researchers and industry leaders [a, b, c, e, f, g, i].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Defining AI in Policy versus Practice", "author": "P.
