{"response": "The question of whether chocolate or vanilla ice cream is better is subjective and depends on individual preferences. As explained in source [b], if one person says they prefer vanilla over chocolate, and another person says they prefer chocolate over vanilla, both of them are right. This is because the preference for a particular flavor of ice cream is a fact about those individuals' brains, not about the ice cream itself. Therefore, neither chocolate nor vanilla ice cream can be objectively said to be better than the other. It's all a matter of personal taste.", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Decision Theory FAQ", "author": "lukeprog", "date": "2013-02-28", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zEWJBFFMvQ835nq6h/decision-theory-faq"}, "b": {"title": "Vanilla and chocolate and preference judgements", "author": "Swimmer963", "date": "2011-04-18", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mqQCuF2m9jSSAfHYB/vanilla-and-chocolate-and-preference-judgements"}, "c": {"title": "Chocolate Ice Cream After All?", "author": "pallas", "date": "2013-12-09", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iC4NueuGWSwBKPXPh/chocolate-ice-cream-after-all"}, "d": {"title": "Evaluability (And Cheap Holiday Shopping)", "author": "Eliezer Yudkowsky", "date": "2007-11-28", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3T6p93Mut7G8qdkAs/evaluability-and-cheap-holiday-shopping"}, "e": {"title": "[Question] Has there been any work done on the ethics of changing people\u2019s minds?", "author": "mcorvin", "date": "2021-02-03", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PuZNuDNGYGshEWHGj/has-there-been-any-work-done-on-the-ethics-of-changing"}, "f": {"title": "Replace Stereotypes With Experiences", "author": "lifelonglearner", "date": "2018-01-29", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KQx8cK67eWqY5yCKm/replace-stereotypes-with-experiences"}, "g": {"title": "On expected utility, part 4: Dutch books, Cox, and Complete Class", "author": "Joe Carlsmith", "date": "2022-03-24", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wf3BqEWrwbQj3fksF/on-expected-utility-part-4-dutch-books-cox-and-complete"}, "h": {"title": "Return to New York City", "author": "Zvi", "date": "2021-03-15", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xvYDdMJgQDgkEZsim/return-to-new-york-city"}, "i": {"title": "Planning a series: discounting utility", "author": "Psychohistorian", "date": "2011-04-19", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Eu9gmpDLRRudjKMbD/planning-a-series-discounting-utility"}, "j": {"title": "On expected utility, part 3: VNM, separability, and more", "author": "Joe Carlsmith", "date": "2022-03-22", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AYSmTsRBchTdXFacS/on-expected-utility-part-3-vnm-separability-and-more"}, "k": {"title": "Easily Top 20%", "author": "Jacob Falkovich", "date": "2021-09-29", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5b3umjEyEPaTHyiHh/easily-top-20"}}}
