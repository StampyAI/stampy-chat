{"response": "Pascal's Mugging is a thought experiment in decision theory, which is a finite analogue of Pascal's Wager. The scenario involves a hypothetical mugger who approaches you and makes a seemingly outrageous claim: \"Give me five dollars, or I\u2019ll use my magic powers from outside the Matrix to run a Turing machine that simulates and kills 3^^^^3 people\" [b]. The idea is that however small your probability is that the person is telling the truth, they can simply state a number that's grossly larger, and when you calculate the expected utility, it suggests you should give them the five dollars, along with pretty much anything else they ask for [d]. \n\nThe problem arises from the fact that a rational agent chooses those actions with outcomes that, after being weighted by their probabilities, have a greater utility\u2014in other words, those actions with greater expected utility. If an agent\u2019s utilities over outcomes can potentially grow much faster than the probability of those outcomes diminishes, then it will be dominated by tiny probabilities of hugely important outcomes; speculations about low-probability-high-stakes scenarios will come to dominate its moral decision making [b]. \n\nThis thought experiment is often used to highlight potential issues with naive expected utility maximization and the challenges of dealing with scenarios that involve low probabilities but extremely high stakes [d, e].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Pascal\u2019s Mugging Solved", "author": "common_law", "date": "2014-05-27", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9WZAqFzNJ4KrhsqJ7/pascal-s-mugging-solved"}, "b": {"title": "Pascal\u2019s Mugging", "author": "Ruby", "date": "", "url": "https://greaterwrong.com/tag/pascal-s-mugging?showPostCount=true&useTagName=true"}, "c": {"title": "Tactics against Pascal\u2019s Mugging", "author": "ArisKatsaris", "date": "2013-04-25", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gjyvXPqvCZPEtCKLB/tactics-against-pascal-s-mugging"}, "d": {"title": "Thoughts on a possible solution to Pascal\u2019s Mugging", "author": "Dolores1984", "date": "2012-08-01", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/grwvpsnqScQonMWun/thoughts-on-a-possible-solution-to-pascal-s-mugging"}, "e": {"title": "Pascal\u2019s Muggle: Infinitesimal Priors and Strong Evidence", "author": "Eliezer Yudkowsky", "date": "2013-05-08", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ap4KfkHyxjYPDiqh2/pascal-s-muggle-infinitesimal-priors-and-strong-evidence"}, "f": {"title": "Why We Can\u2019t Take Expected Value Estimates Literally (Even When They\u2019re Unbiased)", "author": "HoldenKarnofsky", "date": "2011-08-18", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RdpqsQ6xbHzyckW9m/why-we-can-t-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even"}, "g": {"title": "What do you mean by Pascal\u2019s mugging?", "author": "XiXiDu", "date": "2014-11-20", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nXEvx7Mddq7AWWetz/what-do-you-mean-by-pascal-s-mugging"}, "h": {"title": "Pascal\u2019s Mugging as an epistemic problem", "author": "[deleted]", "date": "2010-10-04", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zrTdssTiDzpvNrybR/pascal-s-mugging-as-an-epistemic-problem"}, "i": {"title": "Comments on Pascal\u2019s Mugging", "author": "[deleted]", "date": "2012-05-03", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5y65oJGeXvCvggYoz/comments-on-pascal-s-mugging"}, "j": {"title": "Is AI Safety a Pascal's Mugging-by Robert Miles-video_id JRuNA2eK7w0-date 201905", "author": "Rob Miles", "date": "", "url": ""}, "k": {"title": "Chasing Infinities", "author": "Michael Bateman", "date": "2021-08-16", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/o42zugvMWbJXai6x3/chasing-infinities"}, "l": {"title": "Against Expected Utility", "author": "Houshalter", "date": "2015-09-23", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vqB8n72rWE7GPCNP7/against-expected-utility"}, "m": {"title": "Alternate approaches to Pascal\u2019s Mugging", "author": "DataPacRat", "date": "2012-10-13", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NKqa3mWsnoohrwvfb/alternate-approaches-to-pascal-s-mugging"}, "n": {"title": "The AI Does Not Hate You: Superintelligence, Rationality and the Race to Save the World", "author": "Tom Chivers", "date": "2019-06-13", "url": ""}, "o": {"title": "The Inside View #2\u2013Connor Leahy-by The Inside View-video_id HAFoIRNiKYE-date 202", "author": "Connor Leahy, Michael Trazzi", "date": "", "url": ""}}}
