{"response": "Advanced AI has the potential to significantly impact society in various ways in the long term. \n\nOne of the major concerns is the potential for AI to disrupt job markets and exacerbate economic inequality [b, f]. As AI systems become more capable, they could automate a large number of jobs over a relatively short time period, leading to a spike in unemployment [f]. This could also lead to an extreme concentration of wealth and power, potentially based on new mechanisms of power [e].\n\nAnother potential impact is the threat to privacy and personal data. Data-intensive AI applications could change norms around privacy, leading to long-lasting and irreversible consequences [c]. \n\nAdvanced AI could also pose a threat to democracy and societal stability. For example, robust totalitarianism could be enabled by advanced lie detection, social manipulation, autonomous weapons, and ubiquitous physical sensors and digital footprints [d]. This could shift power and control away from the public and towards elites and leaders, making democratic regimes vulnerable [d].\n\nIn the realm of security, advanced AI could give rise to extreme first-strike advantages, power shifts, or novel destructive capabilities, each of which could tempt a great power to initiate a preventive war [d]. The opacity of these systems could also lead to issues such as the 2010 Flash Crash and will likely lead to larger issues in the future [f].\n\nFurthermore, advanced AI could transform collective decision-making processes through democratic governments or other institutions, and cause large-scale changes in human capabilities and identities [e]. \n\nLastly, there is the existential risk posed by advanced AI systems. If AI systems become highly capable and humans lose the ability to meaningfully understand or intervene in such systems, it could lead to a loss of sovereignty [f]. This could pose an existential threat to humanity unless specific measures are put in place to ensure control over these AI systems [c, f]. \n\nThese potential impacts highlight the importance of ongoing research and policy debate to manage the societal impacts of AI [g, h].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Max \u2013 A Thought Experiment: Could AI Run the Economy Better Than Markets?", "author": "Laura Elbaum", "date": "2020-02-11", "url": "https://aipulse.org/max-a-thought-experiment-could-ai-run-the-economy-better-than-markets/"}, "b": {"title": "Strategic Implications of Openness in AI Development", "author": "Nick Bostrom", "date": "", "url": "10.1111/1758-5899.12403"}, "c": {"title": "Beyond Near- and Long-Term: Towards a Clearer Account of Research Priorities in AI Ethics and Societ", "author": "Carina Prunkl, Jess Whittlestone", "date": "2020-01-13", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04335v2"}, "d": {"title": "AI Governance: A Research Agenda", "author": "Allan Dafoe", "date": "", "url": ""}, "e": {"title": "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s Societal Impacts, Governance, and Ethics: Introduction to the 2019 Summer ", "author": "Laura Elbaum", "date": "2019-09-26", "url": "https://aipulse.org/artificial-intelligences-societal-impacts-governance-and-ethics-introduction-to-the-2019-summer-institute-on-ai-and-society-and-its-rapid-outputs/"}, "f": {"title": "Long-Term and Short-Term Challenges to Ensuring the Safety of AI Systems", "author": "jsteinhardt", "date": "2015-06-24", "url": "https://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/2015/06/24/long-term-and-short-term-challenges-to-ensuring-the-safety-of-ai-systems/"}, "g": {"title": "Artificial Intelligence in Strategic Context: an Introduction", "author": "Shayda Jalali", "date": "2019-02-08", "url": "https://aipulse.org/artificial-intelligence-in-strategic-context-an-introduction/"}, "h": {"title": "Bridging the gap: the case for an 'Incompletely Theorized Agreement' on AI policy", "author": "Charlotte Stix, Matthijs Maas", "date": "", "url": "10.1007/s43681-020-00037-w"}, "i": {"title": "Working in AI _ Jan Leike, Helen Toner, Malo Bourgon, and Miles Brundage-by Cent", "author": "Ajeya Cotra, Andrew Snyder-Beattie, Helen toner, Jan Leike, Malo Bourgon, Miles Brundage", "date": "", "url": ""}, "j": {"title": "'Solving for X?'
