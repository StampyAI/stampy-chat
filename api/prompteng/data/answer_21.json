{"response": "AI could pose an existential risk (x-risk) even if some populations aren't connected to the internet. This is because the potential harm from AI isn't limited to direct interaction with humans via the internet. \n\nFirstly, an AI with access to the internet could cause significant harm by hacking into various systems, such as power grids, nuclear facilities, or financial systems, causing widespread chaos and destruction [b]. This could affect even those populations that aren't directly connected to the internet.\n\nSecondly, AI could be used to create or control physical systems, such as autonomous weapons or infrastructure. If these systems were to malfunction or be used maliciously, they could cause significant harm [c]. \n\nThirdly, AI could be used to manipulate information and influence human behavior on a large scale, leading to societal disruption or conflict [c]. \n\nFinally, the development of AI could lead to a power concentration in the hands of a few, potentially leading to a dystopian future [i]. \n\nTherefore, even populations not directly connected to the internet could be affected by the risks posed by AI [b, c, i].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "People neglect small probability events", "author": "XiXiDu", "date": "2011-07-02", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/R2uQdr8EJFvFRQrNE/people-neglect-small-probability-events"}, "b": {"title": "Risks from general artificial intelligence without an intelligence explosion", "author": "Victoria Krakovna", "date": "2015-11-30", "url": "https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/2015/11/29/ai-risk-without-an-intelligence-explosion/"}, "c": {"title": "Classification of Global Catastrophic Risks Connected with Artificial Intelligence", "author": "Alexey Turchin, David Denkenberger", "date": "", "url": "10.1007/s00146-018-0845-5"}, "d": {"title": "Is an Intelligence Explosion a Disjunctive or Conjunctive Event?", "author": "XiXiDu", "date": "2011-11-14", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j52uErqofDiJZCo76/is-an-intelligence-explosion-a-disjunctive-or-conjunctive"}, "e": {"title": "A list of good heuristics that the case for AI x-risk fails", "author": "capybaralet", "date": "2019-12-02", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bd2K3Jdz82csjCFob/a-list-of-good-heuristics-that-the-case-for-ai-x-risk-fails"}, "f": {"title": "Global Catastrophic Risks", "author": "Bostrom, Nick; Cirkovic, Milan M.; Rees, Martin J., Milan M. \u0106irkovi\u0107", "date": "", "url": ""}, "g": {"title": "Image: Another uninformed perspective on risks from AI (humor)", "author": "XiXiDu", "date": "2011-01-15", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ChusoceeA9fqsrLE8/image-another-uninformed-perspective-on-risks-from-ai-humor"}, "h": {"title": "Elites and AI: Stated Opinions", "author": "lukeprog", "date": "2013-06-15", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ToNNGwqNS5kecZaNQ/elites-and-ai-stated-opinions"}, "i": {"title": "Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies", "author": "Nick Bostrom", "date": "", "url": ""}, "j": {"title": "AI Risk for Epistemic Minimalists", "author": "Alex Flint", "date": "2021-08-22", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8fpzBHt7e6n7Qjoo9/ai-risk-for-epistemic-minimalists"}, "k": {"title": "What I would like the SIAI to publish", "author": "XiXiDu", "date": "2010-11-01", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/43xgZWSCYAKs7Z9F2/what-i-would-like-the-siai-to-publish"}, "l": {"title": "The Precipice", "author": "Toby Ord", "date": "2020-03-24", "url": ""}, "m": {"title": "Solomon's Code", "author": "Olaf Groth", "date": "2018-10-12", "url": ""}, "n": {"title": "Human Compatible", "author": "Stuart Russell", "date": "2019-10-08", "url": ""}, "o": {"title": "Hard Choices in Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Normative Uncertainty through Sociotechnical Com", "author": "Roel Dobbe, Thomas Krendl Gilbert, Yonatan Mintz", "date": "2019-11-20", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09005v1"}}}
