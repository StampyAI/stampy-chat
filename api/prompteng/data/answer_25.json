{"response": "AI safety and alignment research is a broad field with many different areas of focus. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Safety Engineering: This involves designing AI systems to be fail-safe and robust to design errors. An example of this is research into the design of objective functions that allow an agent to be shut down, but do not give that agent incentives to cause or prevent shutdown [j].\n\n2. Target Selection: This involves defining the goals or objectives of an AI system in a way that aligns with human values and interests. This is a complex task due to the difficulty of specifying our values and the potential for unintended consequences [a, d].\n\n3. Alignment Theory: This is a more abstract area of research that aims to develop theoretical frameworks for aligning AI systems with human values. This includes work on robust inverse reinforcement learning, which involves designing reward-based agents to learn human values in contexts where observed behavior may reveal biases or ignorance in place of genuine preferences [j, a].\n\n4. Research Assistants: There is also research into developing AI systems that can assist with AI alignment research itself. This includes AI systems that can organize and summarize AI safety writings, make the case for AI alignment to skeptics, and even generate novel FAI proposals [c].\n\n5. Multi-Agent Interactions: Understanding and designing useful and modular single/\u200bsingle interactions is a good first step toward understanding multi/\u200bmulti interactions. This is important for ensuring existential safety [b].\n\n6. Human Interaction: Research is also being conducted into how people interact with AI alignment algorithms. This involves investigating the psychology of human rationality, emotion, and biases [l].\n\n7. Reducing Autonomy: Some research focuses on reducing the autonomy of AI systems to increase safety. This involves designing systems that base their behavior on their users\u2019 instructions rather than pursuing their own objectives [m].\n\n8. International Treaties: There is also research into the societal and political aspects of AI safety, such as the establishment of international treaties governing the use of AI technologies [b].\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many areas of AI safety and alignment research currently being pursued [a, b, c, d, j, l, m].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Safety engineering, target selection, and alignment theory", "author": "Nate Soares", "date": "2015-12-31", "url": "https://intelligence.org/2015/12/31/safety-engineering-target-selection-and-alignment-theory/"}, "b": {"title": "Some AI research areas and their relevance to existential safety", "author": "Andrew_Critch", "date": "2020-11-19", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hvGoYXi2kgnS3vxqb/some-ai-research-areas-and-their-relevance-to-existential-1"}, "c": {"title": "[Question] What AI safety problems need solving for safe AI research assistants?", "author": "John_Maxwell", "date": "2019-11-05", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oDyCKT2admtoQeiTk/what-ai-safety-problems-need-solving-for-safe-ai-research"}, "d": {"title": "Safety engineering, target selection, and alignment theory", "author": "So8res", "date": "2015-12-31", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uP87YbXrCDCw78rJF/safety-engineering-target-selection-and-alignment-theory"}, "e": {"title": "Introductory resources on AI safety research", "author": "Victoria Krakovna", "date": "2016-02-28", "url": "https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/2016/02/28/introductory-resources-on-ai-safety-research/"}, "f": {"title": "[Link] Eric Schmidt\u2019s new AI2050 Fund", "author": "Aryeh Englander", "date": "2022-02-16", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/t9EgbXcCb6KKLsryB/link-eric-schmidt-s-new-ai2050-fund"}, "g": {"title": "The Open Philanthropy Project_s work on AI risk _ Helen Toner _ EA Global - Lond", "author": "Helen toner, Simran Dhaliwal", "date": "", "url": ""}, "h": {"title": "Evolutionary Computation and AI Safety: Research Problems Impeding Routine and Safe Real-world Appli", "author": "Joel Lehman", "date": "2019-06-24", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10189v2"}, "i": {"title": "Alignment for Advanced Machine Learning Systems", "author": "Jessica Taylor, Eliezer Yudkowsky, Patrick Lavictoire, Andrew Critch", "date": "", "url": ""}, "j": {"title": "Submission to the OSTP on AI outcomes", "author": "Nate Soares", "date": "2016-07-24", "url": "https://intelligence.org/2016/07/23/ostp/"}, "k": {"title": "When is AI safety research harmful?", "author": "NathanBarnard", "date": "2022-05-09", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tdnEZjKBbF4kLzxvF/when-is-ai-safety-research-harmful"}, "l": {"title": "[Link] OpenAI on why we need social scientists", "author": "ioannes", "date": "2019-02-19", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xkRRRZ7Pdny7AQK5r/link-openai-on-why-we-need-social-scientists"}, "m": {"title": "New paper: \u201cAlignment for advanced machine learning systems\u201d", "author": "Rob Bensinger", "date": "2016-07-27", "url": "https://intelligence.org/2016/07/27/alignment-machine-learning/"}, "n": {"title": "Open Problems in Cooperative AI", "author": "Allan Dafoe, Edward Hughes, Yoram Bachrach, Tantum Collins, Kevin R.
