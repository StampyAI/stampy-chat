{"response": "AI safety and alignment are two interrelated concepts in the field of artificial intelligence research that focus on ensuring that AI systems are beneficial and do not pose risks to humanity.\n\nAI safety refers to the research field that aims to make AI systems safe and to drive the broad adoption of such research across the AI community [b]. It involves ensuring that AI systems operate within safe limits even when faced with perturbations like adversarial inputs or distributional shift, and that they can recover from these problems [c]. Safety also includes the development of tools for proactively assessing the safety of a system or approach [i]. It's both a technical and ethical concern, where potentially negative impacts on society could occur due to unintended accidents or failures [k].\n\nAI alignment, on the other hand, is the problem of how to build AI systems that are aligned with human interests [e]. It refers to a cluster of technically well-defined problems that aim to ensure that AI systems behave in a way that is conducive to human values [a, l]. This involves making sure that an AI system's behavior aligns with the operator's true intentions [c]. The problem of AI alignment is complex and likely requires solving many open problems in mathematics, economics, computer science, and philosophy [e].\n\nWhile these two concepts are related and both crucial for the responsible development and deployment of AI, they are not the same. AI alignment is not trivially helpful to existential safety, and efforts to make it helpful require a certain amount of societal-scale steering to guide them [a]. AI alignment solutions could pose novel problems for existential safety, and progress in AI alignment could hasten the pace at which high-powered AI systems are rolled out, potentially shortening society\u2019s headway for establishing safety measures [a].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Some AI research areas and their relevance to existential safety", "author": "Andrew_Critch", "date": "2020-11-19", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hvGoYXi2kgnS3vxqb/some-ai-research-areas-and-their-relevance-to-existential-1"}, "b": {"title": "Safety engineering, target selection, and alignment theory", "author": "So8res", "date": "2015-12-31", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uP87YbXrCDCw78rJF/safety-engineering-target-selection-and-alignment-theory"}, "c": {"title": "Alignment Newsletter #26", "author": "Rohin Shah", "date": "2018-10-02", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZANm3Sbu5RxRca2zt/alignment-newsletter-26"}, "d": {"title": "Towards an Axiological Approach to AI Alignment", "author": "G Gordon Worley III", "date": "2017-11-15", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NwxjvegAbLaBJ3TvC/towards-an-axiological-approach-to-ai-alignment-1"}, "e": {"title": "Robustness to fundamental uncertainty in AGI alignment", "author": "G Gordon Worley III", "date": "2018-07-25", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09836v2"}, "f": {"title": "Formally Stating the AI Alignment Problem", "author": "G Gordon Worley III", "date": "2018-02-19", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7dvDgqvqqziSKweRs/formally-stating-the-ai-alignment-problem-1"}, "g": {"title": "How I think students should orient to AI safety _ Buck Shlegeris _ EA Student Su", "author": "Buck Shlegeris, Sofia Davis Vogel", "date": "", "url": ""}, "h": {"title": "Friday Seminar Series- Gillian Hadfield - AI Alignment and Human Normativity-by ", "author": "Gillian Hadfield", "date": "", "url": ""}, "i": {"title": "[AN #72]: Alignment, robustness, methodology, and system building as research priorities for AI safe", "author": "Rohin Shah", "date": "2019-11-06", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hPJMum5CNH5MKe27C/an-72-alignment-robustness-methodology-and-system-building"}, "j": {"title": "Safety engineering, target selection, and alignment theory", "author": "Nate Soares", "date": "2015-12-31", "url": "https://intelligence.org/2015/12/31/safety-engineering-target-selection-and-alignment-theory/"}, "k": {"title": "Know Your Model (KYM): Increasing Trust in AI and Machine Learning", "author": "Mary Roszel, Robert Norvill, Jean Hilger, Radu State", "date": "2021-05-31", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11036v1"}, "l": {"title": "What is AI alignment-by Future Explained-video_id NnDermRo8O0-date 20180703", "author": "Future Explained", "date": "", "url": ""}, "m": {"title": "Evolutionary Computation and AI Safety: Research Problems Impeding Routine and Safe Real-world Appli", "author": "Joel Lehman", "date": "2019-06-24", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10189v2"}, "n": {"title": "Interview with AI Researchers by Vael Gates", "author": "Vael Gates", "date": "2022-05-09", "url": ""}, "o": {"title": "Open Problems in Cooperative AI", "author": "Allan Dafoe, Edward Hughes, Yoram Bachrach, Tantum Collins, Kevin R.
