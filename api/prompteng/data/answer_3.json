{"response": "\"FOOM\" is a term used in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) to describe a rapid, local increase in AI capability. This concept is often associated with the idea of a \"hard takeoff\", where an AI system undergoes recursive self-improvement, leading to a sudden and dramatic increase in intelligence. In a FOOM scenario, an AI system becomes significantly smarter than anything else around in a very short time period, capable of delivering technological advancements that would take humans decades to achieve [a, e].\n\nThe term \"FOOM\" is also used to describe the desired case of a Friendly AI, which is an AI system that is built using deep insight and never makes any changes to itself that could potentially alter its internal values. This AI system is designed to maintain its internal search criterion for actions, rather than focusing on external consequences [a].\n\nIt's important to note that the concept of FOOM doesn't necessarily imply a hard takeoff, which is often defined as a FOOM occurring in less than six months. The rate of acquisition of important knowledge and the computational resources required for such a rapid increase in efficiency are factors that could limit the possibility of a hard takeoff [b].", "citations": {"a": {"title": "AI Foom Debate", "author": "Robin Hanson, Eliezer Yudkowsky", "date": "2013-01-01", "url": ""}, "b": {"title": "Information theory and FOOM", "author": "PhilGoetz", "date": "2009-10-14", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KqhHhsBRzbf7eckTS/information-theory-and-foom"}, "c": {"title": "Let Your Workers Gather Food", "author": "D_Malik", "date": "2011-10-24", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j2v6yymMvzwczYXmg/let-your-workers-gather-food"}, "d": {"title": "Yudkowsky and Christiano discuss \"Takeoff Speeds\"", "author": "Eliezer Yudkowsky", "date": "2021-11-22", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vwLxd6hhFvPbvKmBH/yudkowsky-and-christiano-discuss-takeoff-speeds"}, "e": {"title": "Recursive Self-Improvement", "author": "Eliezer Yudkowsky", "date": "2008-12-01", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JBadX7rwdcRFzGuju/recursive-self-improvement"}}}
