{"response": "An AI arms race refers to a competitive dynamic where different entities, such as nations or corporations, strive to outpace each other in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies. This competition can occur in various sectors, including the military, social media, and more [a, b, i]. \n\nIn the military context, an AI arms race can involve the development of autonomous weapons systems and other AI-enhanced military capabilities. The goal is often to gain a relative advantage over adversaries, for instance, by using AI to make faster and better combat decisions [a, g]. \n\nIn the private sector, an example of an AI arms race could be between AI teams at social media companies tasked with removing inappropriate content and people who post such content [a].\n\nThe term \"arms race\" is often used to describe a situation where the rapid advancement of AI technologies could lead to the deployment of systems that are not fully understood or controlled, potentially resulting in catastrophic accidents or escalation of conflicts [d, e]. \n\nIt's important to note that the term \"AI arms race\" is sometimes contested, with some arguing that the current dynamics of AI development do not meet the traditional definition of an 'arms race' [b, g]. Nonetheless, the term is widely used to describe the competitive and potentially risky dynamics in AI development.", "citations": {"a": {"title": "Collective action on artificial intelligence: A primer and review", "author": "Robert De Neufville, Seth Baum", "date": "", "url": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101649"}, "b": {"title": "[AN #155]: A Minecraft benchmark for algorithms that learn without reward functions", "author": "Rohin Shah", "date": "2021-07-08", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7YgzDYx4FhdB3TmR/an-155-a-minecraft-benchmark-for-algorithms-that-learn"}, "c": {"title": "International cooperation vs. AI arms race", "author": "Brian_Tomasik", "date": "2013-12-05", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vw9QAviBxcGodMHfN/international-cooperation-vs-ai-arms-race"}, "d": {"title": "Artificial Intelligence: American Attitudes and Trends", "author": "Baobao Zhang, Allan Dafoe", "date": "", "url": ""}, "e": {"title": "Why those who care about catastrophic and existential risk should care about autonomous weapons ", "author": "aaguirre", "date": "2020-11-11", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Btrmh6T62tB4g9RMc/why-those-who-care-about-catastrophic-and-existential-risk"}, "f": {"title": "Roger Grosse _ How can deep learning research inform long-term AI safety-by Schw", "author": "Gillian Hadfield, Question from Audience, Roger Grosse", "date": "", "url": ""}, "g": {"title": "AI Alignment Podcast: On Lethal Autonomous Weapons with Paul Scharre", "author": "Palus Astra", "date": "2020-03-16", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xEzudcydk7APZbnai/ai-alignment-podcast-on-lethal-autonomous-weapons-with-paul"}, "h": {"title": "A bridge to Dath Ilan?
