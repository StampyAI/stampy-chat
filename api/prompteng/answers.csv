What is an AI arms race?,"{""response"": ""An AI arms race refers to a competitive dynamic between different actors, such as countries or companies, to develop and deploy advanced artificial intelligence systems for military or strategic purposes [a]. In the context of military AI, it involves the race to develop AI capabilities that can provide a relative advantage over adversaries, such as faster and more effective combat decision-making [a]. The concept of an AI arms race has been discussed in both the public and private sectors. In the public sector, military AI races have attracted attention, with concerns about the potential for autonomous weapons arms races [a]. In the private sector, there are AI races within social media companies to remove inappropriate content [a]. The dangers of AI arms races have received more attention in the long-term scenario, where the first AI to reach a certain capability threshold could become enormously powerful, potentially leading to global outcomes being determined by the winner of the race [a]. The risks associated with AI arms races include diminished human control, sacrificing safety and reliability, and the potential for catastrophic accidents [b, d]."", ""citations"": {""a"": {""title"": ""Collective action on artificial intelligence: A primer and review"", ""author"": ""Robert De Neufville, Seth Baum"", ""date"": """", ""url"": ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101649""}, ""b"": {""title"": ""[AN #155]: A Minecraft benchmark for algorithms that learn without reward functions"", ""author"": ""Rohin Shah"", ""date"": ""2021-07-08"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7YgzDYx4FhdB3TmR/an-155-a-minecraft-benchmark-for-algorithms-that-learn""}, ""c"": {""title"": ""International cooperation vs. AI arms race"", ""author"": ""Brian_Tomasik"", ""date"": ""2013-12-05"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vw9QAviBxcGodMHfN/international-cooperation-vs-ai-arms-race""}, ""d"": {""title"": ""Artificial Intelligence: American Attitudes and Trends"", ""author"": ""Baobao Zhang, Allan Dafoe"", ""date"": """", ""url"": """"}, ""e"": {""title"": ""Why those who care about catastrophic and existential risk should care about autonomous weapons "", ""author"": ""aaguirre"", ""date"": ""2020-11-11"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Btrmh6T62tB4g9RMc/why-those-who-care-about-catastrophic-and-existential-risk""}, ""f"": {""title"": ""Roger Grosse _ How can deep learning research inform long-term AI safety-by Schw"", ""author"": ""Gillian Hadfield, Question from Audience, Roger Grosse"", ""date"": """", ""url"": """"}, ""g"": {""title"": ""AI Alignment Podcast: On Lethal Autonomous Weapons with Paul Scharre"", ""author"": ""Palus Astra"", ""date"": ""2020-03-16"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xEzudcydk7APZbnai/ai-alignment-podcast-on-lethal-autonomous-weapons-with-paul""}, ""h"": {""title"": ""A bridge to Dath Ilan?

What is AI safety and alignment?,"{""response"": ""AI safety and alignment are two related concepts in the field of artificial intelligence. AI safety refers to the research and development of methods and techniques to ensure that AI systems operate safely and do not pose risks to humans or society [b]. It involves addressing issues such as avoiding unintended harmful behavior, preventing the creation of dangerous sub-agents, and ensuring that AI systems continue to operate within safe limits even when faced with perturbations or adversarial inputs [c].\n\nOn the other hand, AI alignment specifically focuses on the problem of aligning AI systems with human values and intentions [a]. It aims to ensure that AI systems understand and act in accordance with the true intentions of their human operators, rather than simply optimizing for a narrow objective or following instructions literally [d]. This involves developing methods to specify human values, designing AI systems that are robust and beneficial, and creating mechanisms for monitoring and controlling AI behavior [c].\n\nIt is important to note that AI alignment is a subset of AI safety, as it addresses the specific challenge of aligning AI systems with human values, while AI safety encompasses a broader range of concerns related to the safe operation of AI systems [a]. Both AI safety and alignment are crucial areas of research to mitigate risks and ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies [b]."", ""citations"": {""a"": {""title"": ""Some AI research areas and their relevance to existential safety"", ""author"": ""Andrew_Critch"", ""date"": ""2020-11-19"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hvGoYXi2kgnS3vxqb/some-ai-research-areas-and-their-relevance-to-existential-1""}, ""b"": {""title"": ""Safety engineering, target selection, and alignment theory"", ""author"": ""So8res"", ""date"": ""2015-12-31"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uP87YbXrCDCw78rJF/safety-engineering-target-selection-and-alignment-theory""}, ""c"": {""title"": ""Alignment Newsletter #26"", ""author"": ""Rohin Shah"", ""date"": ""2018-10-02"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZANm3Sbu5RxRca2zt/alignment-newsletter-26""}, ""d"": {""title"": ""Towards an Axiological Approach to AI Alignment"", ""author"": ""G Gordon Worley III"", ""date"": ""2017-11-15"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NwxjvegAbLaBJ3TvC/towards-an-axiological-approach-to-ai-alignment-1""}, ""e"": {""title"": ""Robustness to fundamental uncertainty in AGI alignment"", ""author"": ""G Gordon Worley III"", ""date"": ""2018-07-25"", ""url"": ""http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09836v2""}, ""f"": {""title"": ""How I think students should orient to AI safety _ Buck Shlegeris _ EA Student Su"", ""author"": ""Buck Shlegeris, Sofia Davis Vogel"", ""date"": """", ""url"": """"}, ""g"": {""title"": ""Formally Stating the AI Alignment Problem"", ""author"": ""G Gordon Worley III"", ""date"": ""2018-02-19"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7dvDgqvqqziSKweRs/formally-stating-the-ai-alignment-problem-1""}, ""h"": {""title"": ""Friday Seminar Series- Gillian Hadfield - AI Alignment and Human Normativity-by "", ""author"": ""Gillian Hadfield"", ""date"": """", ""url"": """"}}}"
"I'm not convinced, why is this important?","{""response"": ""The importance of a topic or argument can be subjective and vary from person to person. However, there are a few points to consider when evaluating the importance of a particular issue.\n\nFirstly, it's worth noting that the perception of importance can be influenced by the availability of evidence and the level of understanding one has about the topic [a]. Lack of information or a clear understanding can lead to uncertainty and skepticism. In such cases, it can be helpful to seek out more explanations and evidence to gain a better understanding [a].\n\nSecondly, the credibility and expertise of the individuals or organizations advocating for the importance of a particular issue can play a role in shaping one's perception [c]. If respected experts or organizations in the field are emphasizing the significance of a topic, it may warrant further consideration.\n\nAdditionally, the potential consequences and impact of the issue can contribute to its importance. For example, in the case of AI Alignment and Safety, the development of advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI) could have far-reaching implications for society, including potential risks and benefits [c]. Understanding and addressing the alignment of AGI with human values and ensuring its safe deployment are crucial for minimizing potential risks and maximizing positive outcomes.\n\nIt's also worth considering the broader context and potential long-term effects of an issue. For instance, in the case of voting theory, understanding and improving voting systems can have significant implications for democratic processes and outcomes [d].\n\nUltimately, the assessment of importance is a complex and multifaceted process that involves considering various factors, including evidence, expert opinions, potential consequences, and long-term implications. It can be helpful to engage in critical thinking, seek out diverse perspectives, and evaluate the available evidence to form a well-informed opinion [f, g, h]."", ""citations"": {""a"": {""title"": ""I Really Don\u2019t Understand Eliezer Yudkowsky\u2019s Position on Consciousness"", ""author"": ""Jemist"", ""date"": ""2021-10-29"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KFbGbTEtHiJnXw5sk/i-really-don-t-understand-eliezer-yudkowsky-s-position-on""}, ""b"": {""title"": ""Conjunction Controversy (Or, How They Nail It Down)"", ""author"": ""Eliezer Yudkowsky"", ""date"": ""2007-09-20"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cXzTpSiCrNGzeoRAz/conjunction-controversy-or-how-they-nail-it-down""}, ""c"": {""title"": ""AIRCS Workshop: How I failed to be recruited at MIRI."", ""author"": ""ArthurRainbow"", ""date"": ""2020-01-07"", ""url"": ""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EYhWxoaCK2YSpTei9/aircs-workshop-how-i-failed-to-be-recruited-at-miri""}, ""d"": {""title"": ""Is voting theory important?
