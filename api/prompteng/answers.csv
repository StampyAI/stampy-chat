What is an AI arms race?,"An AI arms race refers to a competitive dynamic between different actors, such as countries or companies, to develop and deploy advanced artificial intelligence systems for military or strategic purposes [a, b, d]. In the context of military AI, it involves the race to develop AI capabilities that can provide a relative advantage over adversaries, such as faster and more effective combat decision-making [a]. The concept of an AI arms race draws parallels to historical arms races, such as the Cold War nuclear arms race, where the focus is on outpacing competitors in terms of technological advancements and capabilities.

The risks associated with an AI arms race can vary depending on the timeframe considered. In the near term, there are concerns about the rapid development and deployment of AI systems without sufficient attention to safety and reliability, potentially leading to unintended consequences and accidents [b]. In the long term, the focus shifts to the potential for an AI project to reach a threshold of capability that could enable it to become enormously powerful, even capable of taking over the world [a]. This raises concerns about global outcomes being determined by the winner of the development race.

It is worth noting that while military AI races have received more attention, there are also AI races in the private sector, such as social media companies competing to remove inappropriate content [a]. However, the focus of this response is primarily on military AI races.","Collective action on artificial intelligence: A primer and review --- Robert De Neufville, Seth Baum ---  --- 10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101649",[AN #155]: A Minecraft benchmark for algorithms that learn without reward functions --- Rohin Shah --- 2021-07-08 --- https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7YgzDYx4FhdB3TmR/an-155-a-minecraft-benchmark-for-algorithms-that-learn,International cooperation vs. AI arms race --- Brian_Tomasik --- 2013-12-05 --- https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vw9QAviBxcGodMHfN/international-cooperation-vs-ai-arms-race,"Artificial Intelligence: American Attitudes and Trends --- Baobao Zhang, Allan Dafoe ---  --- ",Why those who care about catastrophic and existential risk should care about autonomous weapons  --- aaguirre --- 2020-11-11 --- https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Btrmh6T62tB4g9RMc/why-those-who-care-about-catastrophic-and-existential-risk,"Roger Grosse _ How can deep learning research inform long-term AI safety-by Schw --- Gillian Hadfield, Question from Audience, Roger Grosse ---  --- ",AI Alignment Podcast: On Lethal Autonomous Weapons with Paul Scharre --- Palus Astra --- 2020-03-16 --- https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xEzudcydk7APZbnai/ai-alignment-podcast-on-lethal-autonomous-weapons-with-paul,A bridge to Dath Ilan?
